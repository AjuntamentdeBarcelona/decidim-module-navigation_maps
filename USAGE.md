# Using Navigation Maps 
 
Platoniq has come out with a new feature for the Decidim platform, Navigation Maps! This feature allows the administrator to post layouts that display multiple blueprints or maps and highlight sections in which a team or community is working. Participants can then click on these highlighted sections to access processes/assemblies/consultations attached to the space.

This feature is currently available to put on your homepage. Let's check out how!

First you will need to click on settings at the left hand side of your dashboard and then click homepage.
